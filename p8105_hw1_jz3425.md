# Problem 1

**create a data frame comprised of 4 vectors:**

``` r
set.seed(1)

#create a data frame comprised of 4 vectors
my_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c(letters[1:10]),
  vec_factor = factor(c(rep("R", 3), rep("G", 3), rep("B", 4)))
)

my_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_numeric vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1      -0.626 FALSE       a        R         
    ##  2       0.184 TRUE        b        R         
    ##  3      -0.836 FALSE       c        R         
    ##  4       1.60  TRUE        d        G         
    ##  5       0.330 TRUE        e        G         
    ##  6      -0.820 FALSE       f        G         
    ##  7       0.487 TRUE        g        B         
    ##  8       0.738 TRUE        h        B         
    ##  9       0.576 TRUE        i        B         
    ## 10      -0.305 FALSE       j        B

The mean of the numeric vector is 0.1322028.

The mean of the logical vector is 0.6.

The mean of the character and factor vector doesnâ€™t work.

**Convert variables from one type to another:**

``` r
#convert ligical vector to numeric
as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_logical))

#convert character vector to numeric, but this doesn't work
as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_char))

#convert factor vector to numeric
as.numeric(pull(my_df, vec_factor))
```

The logical vector is converted to numeric, as TRUE= 1 and FALSE = 0.

The characters cannot be converted, so the mean is not calculable.

The factor vector was converted to numeric and the mean is 1.9, however
it means nothing.

# Problem 2

``` r
#load the "penguins" dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

**Short description:**

This dataset includes data of 344 penguins and 8 variables of them:
species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year.

Among all the penguins, there are 3 kinds of species: Adelie, Chinstrap,
Gentoo, coming from 3 different islands: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen.

The mean of flipper\_length\_mm is 200.9152047.

**Make a scatter plot:**

``` r
#make a scatter plot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```
